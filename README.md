# cuda-samples-exp

These are various experimental cuda sample utilities and apps. Copy/merge the samples with official cuda-samples distributed with CUDA Toolkit/SDK then compile by running make within the new subdirectories.

These additional samples are meant to test compatibility of various language features such as C++11, libraries, and whatever else one might think of.
